## **📣 Rule Testing Recap: What We Learned From Package C And Bigger Ball Games (And Some Additional Final Thoughts)**

### 

### **🚨 Disclaimer**

For package C played with Bigger Ball, the results will cover **only Open division matches**. We got Bigger Ball matches from US, where package C was played completely with Bigger Ball already. Video coverage from women’s and especially coed matches was very rare. While Package C with Bigger Ball was also tested in the Women’s and Coed divisions, only the Open Division had enough consistent data to support meaningful conclusions. This means that we can analyze the changes of package C (without Bigger Ball) for all divisions, but we will have a complete view on **all** packages for Open division only.

## **🔍 Game Insights – Touches, Possession & Serving**

To better understand *how* Package C and its variants shaped gameplay, we looked at three deeper indicators:

* **Touches per point**  
* **Average change of possession**  
* **First serve percentage**

**🔁 Touches per Point – More Ball Movement, More Play**

| Division | Baseline | Peak Value (Package) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Open | 3.01 | **4.14** (C Bigger Ball) |
| Women | 3.36 | **4.27** (B) |
| Coed | 3.20 | **4.30** (B) |

**Takeaway:** All divisions saw a **notable rise in touches per point**, especially under **Package B and C BB**, showing a clear shift to longer, more involved rallies with more team play.

**🔄 Average Change of Possession – More Back-and-Forth Action**

| Division | Baseline | Peak Value (Package) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Open | 3.20 | **3.59** (A) |
| Women | 3.12 | **3.52** (C) |
| Coed | 3.22 | **3.50** (B) |

**Takeaway:** Games became **more competitive point-by-point**, with multiple changes in possession before a rally ends — especially in Women’s Division under **Package C**.

**🎯 First Serve % – Stable Across Packages**

| Division | Baseline | Highest | Lowest |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Open | 49.96% | 50.53% (A) | **48.46% (C Bigger Ball)** |
| Women | 48.61% | **50.48% (C)** | 48.90% (B) |
| Coed | 47.15% | **49.56% (B)** | 48.56% (C Bigger Ball) |

**Takeaway: Serve reliability remained consistent** across all rule sets. Small shifts suggest players adapted well despite changes to serve rules, with no major impact on consistency.

## **📊 The Game Quality Score: Measuring Overall RRR Goals in One Metric**

To summarize all these elements, we created a single **Game Quality Score** metric where **100 \= ideal game quality** (i.e. it meets all the RRR goal metrics). Negative values and values beyond 100 are possible.

### **🧮 How Is the Game Quality Score set up?**

As a reminder, here’s what the RRR goals are:

| Metric | Ideal Value | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Rally %** | 25% or more | More rallies \= more exciting points ✅ |
| **Double Faults** | Less than 20% | Fewer service errors \= better flow 🚫 |
| **Aces**  | Less than 15% and less than rally % | Aces are fine, but not too dominant 💥 |

And here’s how we calculate the Game Quality Score: 

The score starts at 100

* The greatest weight is given to rally % (±2.5 per % above/below 25%)   
* Double faults are the second biggest factor (+.25 per % below 20, \-2 per % above 20).  
* Aces greater than 15% only hurt the quality score if the ace % is greater than the rally %    
* A bonus is given if the first serve percentage exceeds 70% (half a point for every % over 70\)  
* A bonus is given for longer rallies (Rally % x (3- Average change of possession per rally))

### **📊 How Did the Game Score Change?**

Across all divisions, scores more than doubled, showing a clear, measurable improvement in game flow, fairness, and excitement.

| Package | Open | Women | Coed |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Baseline** | 32.16 | 44.63 | 36.98 |
| **A** | 61.54 | – | – |
| **B** | 78.48 | 80.37 | 87.72 |
| **C** | 61.82 | 71.10 | 64.65 |
| **C \+ Big Ball** | **84.84** | – | – |

### **🔍 Key Takeaways**

* **Massive improvements** across all divisions from the **baseline** to Packages B and C.  
* **Package B** was the **best overall performer** across all three divisions, with exceptionally high scores in **Coed** and **Women’s**.  
* **Package C** (standard) showed moderate improvements—especially for Women—but not quite reaching Package B's peak.  
* **Package C \+ Big Ball (C BB)** delivered the **highest score yet in Open Division**:  
   🔥 **84.84** — the strongest result seen so far in any rule configuration.

### **📌 Interpretation**

* **Big Ball clearly enhances game balance and rally potential**, especially in the Open Division.  
* While Package C without the big ball was solid, it didn’t surpass the high bar set by Package B.  
* These findings suggest that **package** **C with Bigger Ball might offer the best of both worlds**: the structural improvements of Package C *plus* the gameplay benefits of the bigger ball.

## **🔥 Further Analysis**

As always, it's important to interpret these numbers with caution. The sample sizes are relatively small, and many external factors remain uncontrolled. For this latest analysis, we took a more detailed approach—**controlling for variables** such as country, tournament, and tournament stage to better account for potential differences in gameplay context.

You may also notice that we’ve **left out statistical significance markers** in the main summary for the sake of readability. However, detailed tables for each division—including full statistical outputs—are provided at the end of this document for those who want to dive deeper.

In addition, we made an effort to **isolate the effect size of individual rule changes** on the Game Score and other game characteristics. While the findings are both **interesting and encouraging**, they should be interpreted with care. **Absolute values should not be compared directly**, as the underlying assumptions vary across rule components.

### **Overall Takeaways**

1. **The Bigger Ball is the most powerful individual rule change**  
    → Improves consistency, rally length, and overall game quality.  
2. **Larger No-Hit Zones help**, though to a smaller extent  
    → Promotes longer rallies and better quality.  
3. **Expanding the boundary size can hurt game quality**  
    → Possibly makes defense harder and reduces tactical depth.  
4. **TT Rule shows no clear effect**, possibly needing more controlled testing and a greater variety in data.

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Package A** | 7.19 | 7.79 | \+0.60 | \+1.0 |
| **Package B** | 7.37 | 7.83 | \+0.46 | \+1.0 |
| **Package C** | 6.76 | 7.88 | **\+1.11** | **\+1.0** |

- 📌 **Biggest enjoyment gain** across all packages.  
- Without Big Ball: 6.78 → 7.95 (+1.17)  
- With Big Ball: 6.48 → 7.57 (+1.09)  
  *(smaller sample size for Big Ball—interpret with caution)*

**✅ Top Advantages (Most Commonly Mentioned)**

* **More Rallies** (64): Big ball slowed the game, boundary prevented boom balls  
* **Fewer Double Faults / Easier Serves** (21): Bigger ball improved consistency; equal serve rule reduced pressure

**⚠️ Main Disadvantages**

* **Bigger NHZ** (61): Perceived as risky, unfair to women/smaller players  
* **Confusing Serve Rules** (26): Equal serve rotation and scoring unclear to many

**🌍 Direction of the Sport – What Players Think**

| Package | Yes | No | Mixed | Unclear |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A | 72.6% | 6.8% | 9.6% | 11.0% |
| B | 61.2% | 18.2% | 12.4% | 8.3% |
| **C** | **70.8%** | 13.5% | 7.3% | 8.4% |

✅ Package C recovered trust after the more mixed feedback from Package B.

**💡 Most Requested Changes**

* **Bigger Ball** (51): Most frequently requested  
* **Smaller NHZ** (esp. for women) (20): Calls for NHZ reduction  
* **Bigger Boundary** (14): Desire for slightly more space (\~9m)  
* **Bounce Play Options** (11): Interest in bounce-based variations

This is slightly **less positive** than Package A (which had 72.6% “yes” responses), but still shows clear majority support.

## **🏁 Final Remarks**

With **Package C**, the game continues to evolve—and the data shows real progress. Across all divisions, we saw:

* 📈 **More touches and changes of possession** per point  
* 🔁 **Longer, more interactive rallies**  
* 🎯 **Stable serve consistency**, despite structural changes to serving rules

📌 **Package B** still holds the title for the most complete improvement across divisions.  
 But **Package C with Big Ball** emerged as a top contender—especially in the **Open Division**, where it delivered:

* The **highest game score** recorded so far  
* **Longest rallies**  
* And a clear reduction in ace dominance

At the same time, some challenges remain:

* The **larger NHZ** continues to draw concern, particularly from women and smaller players  
* Some players find **equal serve distribution rules** confusing or slowing down play  
* There’s still strong demand for **refined boundaries** and **adjustments to balance** between divisions

Yet despite this, **player sentiment improved significantly**, with **enjoyment rising more in Package C than in any previous rule set**.
