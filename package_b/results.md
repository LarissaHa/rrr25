## **📣 Rule Testing Recap: Did Package B Improve Game Quality?**

### **Thank you\!**

Thank you to everyone who hosted the test tournaments\! Thank you to everyone who filmed games and made them available to us. And a huge thank you to all the analysts in the data team who reviewed and analysed the survey results and countless hours of game footage.

If you know someone who was involved, please thank them\! It's not something we should take for granted that so many people volunteer their time for our sport.

### **📊 Data Overview**

Over the past months, we’ve continued our mission to evolve the sport through thoughtful rule experimentation. This edition of the newsletter dives into the impact of **Package B**, our latest rule test, using both **match data** and **player feedback**.

🔢 In total, the dataset includes **103 official games** played under controlled conditions:

* **44 games** – Open Division  
* **22 games** – Women’s Division  
* **37 games** – Coed Division

Again, just like we did for package A, we analyzed how package B influenced **rallies, serving, sideouts, and overall game quality**.

This newsletter summarizes those findings. Let’s dive in. 👇

### **🧪 Open Division: What Changed with Package B?**

Quick Initial Takeaways:

* 📉 **Double faults** continue to drop—lowest yet under Package B.  
* 🏐 **Rallies are still strong**, but the increase from A to B isn’t statistically significant.  
* 🔁 **Sideouts went up** in Package B (significantly more than in A).  
* 🎯 **Aces decreased**—good for balance, especially since non-ace pressure stayed high.

| Metric | Baseline | Package A | Package B | A → B Change | Baseline → B Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Double Faults** | 27.77 | 22.78 | 17.56 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Rallies** | 8.84 | 14.00 | 16.47 | ❗ *Not significant* | 🔼 *Significantly higher* |
| **Sideouts w/ Defensive Touch** | 14.29 | 12.79 | 13.85 | ❗ Not significant | ❗ Not significant |
| **Sideouts** | 24.62 | 18.88 | 25.66 | 🔼 *Significantly higher* | ❗ Not significant |
| **Aces** | 20.05 | 21.02 | 16.20 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Non-Ace Points on Serve** | 4.84 | 10.52 | 10.20 | ❗ Not significant | ❗ Not significant |

When we say a change is **"statistically significant,"** we mean it’s **very unlikely to be due to random chance**. We conducted t-tests for every category and the result of the t-test was below 0.05 p-value, which is considered as “significant” in scientific experiments (e.g. social sciences).

### **🧪 Women Division: What Changed with Package B?**

Quick Highlights:

* 💥 **Double faults were cut nearly in half**, showing strong improvement in serve reliability.  
* 🏐 **Rallies increased significantly**, suggesting longer, more engaging points.  
* 🔄 **Sideouts rose sharply**, especially with no increase in defensive touches.  
* 🎯 **Aces decreased**, helping balance the power dynamic in serve-receive situations.

| Metric | Baseline | Package B | Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Double Faults** | 25.74 | 13.32 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Rallies** | 9.32 | 15.03 | 🔼 *Significantly higher* |
| **Sideouts w/ Defensive Touch** | 17.12 | 17.85 | ❗ *Not significant* |
| **Sideouts** | 24.17 | 31.24 | 🔼 *Significantly higher* |
| **Aces** | 11.70 | 7.82 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Non-Ace Points on Serve** | 11.93 | 14.74 | ❗ *Not significant* |

### **🧪 Coed Division: What Changed with Package B?**

Key Takeaways:

* 💣 **Aces dropped sharply** — from nearly 23% to under 13%, shifting the game away from pure serve dominance.  
* 🏐 **Rallies more than doubled** — a dramatic and statistically significant improvement in play duration.  
* 📉 **Double faults also dropped** — a sign of cleaner, more consistent serving.  
* 🔁 **Sideout dynamics remained stable**, but with increased non-ace serve pressure and longer rallies.

| Metric | Baseline | Package B | Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Double Faults** | 21.53 | 15.38 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Rallies** | 8.68 | 17.72 | 🔼 *Significantly higher* |
| **Sideouts w/ Defensive Touch** | 13.10 | 15.89 | ❗ *Not significant* |
| **Sideouts** | 27.43 | 25.47 | ❗ *Not significant* |
| **Aces** | 22.99 | 12.77 | 🔽 *Significantly lower* |
| **Non-Ace Points on Serve** | 7.24 | 12.18 | 🔼 *Significantly higher* |

### **🔍 Deep Dive: What’s Behind the Numbers?**

To understand how Package B changed the **overall style and quality of play**, we tracked some key aspects across all three divisions:

**👐 Touches per Point – More Action Every Rally**

| Division | Baseline | Package B | Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Open** | 3.01 | 4.01 \* | 🔼 *Significant increase* |
| **Women** | 3.36 | 4.27 \* | 🔼 *Significant increase* |
| **Coed** | 3.19 | 4.30 \* | 🔼 *Significant increase* |

- **Change of Possession:** stayed stable in comparison to Package A with a slight significant increase for the open division (3.20 changes of possession on an average rally to 3.52)  
- **First Serve Percentage:** remained stable at around 50% for all divisions

📌 **Takeaway:** These quantitative changes point to a more balanced version of the game — longer points, more defensive play, and fewer double faults.

### **🗳️ Calls and Unclear Situations**

One area we also tracked was **on-court calls**—moments where play stopped due to an infraction or disputed situation.

* **Out of Bounds Calls**:  
  * Package A: on average **0.94 per game**  
    Package B: on average **0.30 per game**

* **Package B Only**:  
  * **Redo Calls**: on average **0.30 per game**  
  * **No-Hit Zone (NHZ) Calls**: **0.85 per game** – observers played a **crucial role** in enforcing this rule.  
  * **No-Dive Zone (NDZ) Calls**: **0.16 per game** – relatively rare.

### **📊 The Game Quality Score: Measuring Overall RRR Goals in One Metric**

To summarize all these elements, we created a single **Game Quality Score** metric where **100 \= ideal game quality** (i.e. it meets all the RRR goal metrics). Negative values and values beyond 100 are possible.

### **🧮 How Is the Game Quality Score set up?**

As a reminder, here’s what the RRR goals are:

| Metric | Ideal Value | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Rally %** | 25% or more | More rallies \= more exciting points ✅ |
| **Double Faults** | Less than 20% | Fewer service errors \= better flow 🚫 |
| **Aces**  | Less than 15% and less than rally % | Aces are fine, but not too dominant 💥 |

And here’s how we calculate the Game Quality Score: 

The score starts at 100

* The greatest weight is given to rally % (±2.5 per % above/below 25%)   
* Double faults are the second biggest factor (+.25 per % below 20, \-2 per % above 20).  
* Aces greater than 15% only hurt the quality score if the ace % is greater than the rally %    
* A bonus is given if the first serve percentage exceeds 70% (half a point for every % over 70\)  
* A bonus is given for longer rallies (Rally % x (3- Average change of possession per rally))

### **📊 How Did the Game Score Change?**

Across all divisions, scores more than doubled, showing a clear, measurable improvement in game flow, fairness, and excitement.

| Division | Baseline | Package B | Change |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Open | 32.16 | 78.48 \* | 🔼 *Huge improvement* |
| Women | 44.63 | 80.37 \* | 🔼 *Huge improvement* |
| Coed | 36.98 | 87.72 \* | 🔼 *Huge improvement* |

📌 **What this tells us:**  
 The rule changes in Package A **substantially improved game quality**—more rallies, fewer double faults, and a better balance between serving and playmaking, but there’s still a long way to go to hit our goals.

### **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Survey Snapshot: What Did Players Think of Package B?**
