# deep dive report for package A (metrics)

## Touches per Point
    - increased from 3.2 to 3.5 (for open a significant rise) for open
## Average Change of Possession (for Rallies)
    - increased from 3.2 to 3.6 for open
## First Serve Percentage
    - no changes
## Rally Ratio
    - how many points that are actually played beyond serve, are rallies?
    - 18.6% to 30% for open
## Game Score
    - 100 = RRR target goals, above 100 exceed goals, below 100 fall short of the goals
        - Rallies count a lot, value is reduced when we have a lot of double faults
        - Aces should be lower than rallies
        - The greatest weight is given to rally % (Â±2.5 per % above/below 25%) with reducing double faults as the second biggest factor (+.25 per % below 20, -2 per % above 20).
        - Aces greater than 15% only hurt the quality score if the ace % is greater than the rally %
        - A bonus is given if the first serve percentage exceeds 70%
        - A bonus is given for longer rallies
    - An ideal game with score 100 would have 25% rallies, 20% double faults, 65% first serve percentage, 15% aces and 3 average changes of possession (= minimal rally)
    - The average baseline game was around 39 points, the average package A game was around 64 points
        - when we only look at open games the average game score rises from 32 to 62
